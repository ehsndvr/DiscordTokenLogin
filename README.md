# How it works

After running the program, the program asks the user for a token to log in to the Discord account. After entering the token, the program checks if there is a Chrome or Edge browser in your system, if there is one of these browsers, one of the Opens them otherwise it starts downloading Chromium.
The token is validated, and if the token is not obsolete, the program displays user information in the console environment, opens the browser, and goes to the site.
A JavaScript code is injected into the Discord page and the user logs in to the token account.
